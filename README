urlyconnect 0.1
---------------

urlyconnect will initiate 8 simultaneous SSH connections to a chosen
host, test them for stability over a period of approximately 30
seconds, select one which is still working at the end of this period
and run an additional SSH client on the existing stable TCP
connection.

This is done for a very specific use-case: dealing with strange
connection drop-outs when attempting to create an SSH tunnel on the
student network at the University of Tasmania. It may or may not be
useful for any other network conditions ever.

Compilation/Installation
------------------------

Simply type `make' to compile. Move the binary `urlyconnect' to a
convenient location such as /usr/local/bin.


Usage
-----

* Set up passwordless authentication by placing a local ssh key in the
  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the server.

* Ensure that the user with which you are logging in will have a shell
  with the "echo" command (such as bash).

* Execute urlyconnect with the options:

  urlyconnect [user@]hostname [ssh-port [tunnel-port]]

  ssh-port: SSH port to use (default 22)
  tunnel-port: If specified, uses ssh -D with this as the proxy port


Known Issues
------------

* Ubuntu Karmic Koala: This has a slightly old version of OpenSSH
  (5.1p1) which has a bug with the -D option, such that a subsequent
  client connecting using a ControlMaster socket with the -D option
  will not create the local listening port as expected.

  Using version 5.5 or later of the OpenSSH client resolves this
  problem.
